- 👋 Hi, I’m @darkpajamaz
- 👀 I’m interested in game design 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do literally anything. my goal is to make game design a hobby by working with engines that require minimal code, 
- and slowly work my way up to understanding any of this. I am not the smartest of men, and see this taking a long time to accomplish. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, as I am so unexprienced that you will likely be held back by me 
- 📫 How to reach me, coltond123@gmail.com, or discord fluffyking#4531
